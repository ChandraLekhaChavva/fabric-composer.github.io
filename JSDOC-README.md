# Concerto API
Concerto is an application development framework for building blockchain applications based on Hyperledger. This is the API JSDoc for the Concerto Client, Admin and Runtime Javascript APIs.

[User Documentation](https://pages.github.ibm.com/Blockchain-WW-Labs/Concerto/) is on the gh-pages branch of the Concerto git repository


## Overview
The major components of Concerto are:

1. The Concerto language for describing the structure of resources (assets, participants
and transactions) that participate in a blockchain-mediated business network.
2. Javascript APIs to query, create, update and delete resources and submit transactions
 from client applications. Concerto resources are stored on the blockchain.
3. Javascript transaction processor functions that runs on Hyperledger when transactions are
submitted for processing. These functions may update the state of resources
stored on the blockchain via server-side Concerto APIs.
4. The Composer utility and tools to interactively test Concerto-based
solutions.
