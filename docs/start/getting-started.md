# Getting started with Concerto Application Development
The major components of Concerto are:

- The Concerto language for describing the structure of resources (assets, participants and transactions) that participate in a blockchain-mediated business network.
- Javascript APIs to query, create, update and delete resources and submit transactions from client applications. Concerto resources are stored on the blockchain.
- Javascript transaction processor functions that runs on Hyperledger when transactions are submitted for processing. These functions may update the state of resources stored on the blockchain via server-side Concerto APIs.
- The Composer utility and tools to interactively test Concerto-based solutions.

# Where to get started?

Firstly it's worth reading the [Overview](../overview/overview.md) - this will give you the essential background and context.

**Developers** - do you want to start with the sample application in the git repo and get some code running?  Head to the [Getting Started](../start/getting-started-cmd-line.md)

**Analysts** - do you want to start modeling the business network?  Head to the [Getting Started with Composer](../start/getting-started-composer.md)


# Good places to go next

- It's worth reading more about the [Concepts](../concepts/index.md)
- There are common tasks that need to be performed - check out the [Task Map](../tasks/index.md)
