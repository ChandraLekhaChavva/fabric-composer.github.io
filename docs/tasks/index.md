# Tasks

Tasks describe the typical operations that an analyst, developer, operations engineer or architect should perform. These are anchored using the Task Map, a visual representation of the core tasks, how they interrelate and how they are sequenced.

The Task Map may be used for navigation, but is primarily a mechanism to help you understand what tasks you should be thinking about, given the state of your project.

#Task Map

The task map is composed of the following phases, with each phase exposing a set of tasks. The phases are sequenced as follows:

<div style="border-width:1px; border-style:double; border-color:lightgreen; padding:2em;font-size:20px;color:firebrick;strong;">
Model -> Define Business Network -> Deploy -> Test -> Generate Application
</div>
